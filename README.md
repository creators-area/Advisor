## But wait, S&box isn't out yet?!

Indeed, this is written in a somewhat game agnostic fashion so we can port it to S&box once we have access to it.
As such, there likely won't be a lot of networking, UI, or data storage involved until we're certain of what we'll be able to use.

*Psst Garry, help some developers out will ya?*

## What is λdvisor?

λdvisor (read: Advisor) is an administration addon in heavily development, built to provide the following features to your servers:

- String based permission system.
- Moderation commands.
- Full administrative control of your server through an in-game menu.
- Logging of user actions such as joining, leaving, chat messages, kills, bans and more.

As well as more down the line once we get more access to S&box. We're open for suggestions!

## I'm a developer, what would λdvisor bring to me?

We'll be creating a simple to use API to give you access to the following features:

- Custom commands through simple to use attributes and preconditions.
- Querying the permissions service and adding custom permissions.
- Implementing custom logging of your addon's events.
- Access to custom events used by λdvisor with possibility of overriding results.
- And more down the line!

## Special Thanks

This addon is under development in collaboration with the community at Game Creators Area.

*Do note the community there mostly speaks French.*
