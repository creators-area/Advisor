# OverwÎ»tch
An open source and expendable administration framework for your S&amp;box servers and addons.

## But wait, S&box isn't out yet?!

Indeed, this is written in a somewhat game agnostic fashion so we can port it to S&box once we have access to it.
As such, there likely won't be a lot of networking, UI, or data storage involved until we're certain of what we'll be able to use.

*Psst Garry, help some developers out will ya?*
